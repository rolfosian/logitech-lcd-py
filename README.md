# logitech-lcd-py
 Basic wrapper for `LogitechLcd.dll` using ctypes, tooled from `LogitechLcd.h` in the Logitech G15 SDK
 
 Requires Logitech Gaming Software driver installed and running.
 
 Basic testing done with a Logitech G15 V2 keyboard monochrome LCD. I don't have a color one on hand to test with but I don't see why those functions shouldn't work also.
